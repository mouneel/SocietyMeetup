You need to do following:
1) Create an account with Github.
2) I will add you to collobarate once i have your userid.
3) You will receive the invite to collobarate.
4) You once you accept the invite you will see the project "SocietyMeetup".
5) You can use the Pull option to pull the project into your local github - desktop application. But remember that you will have to do it from home as from within ATOS network it is failing.
